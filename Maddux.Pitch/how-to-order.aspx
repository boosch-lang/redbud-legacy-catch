    <h1>New Ways to Order!</h1>
    <p>
        We are excited to show you the new version of our website. Built with simplicity in mind, you will be able to place an order whether your at your computer or using a mobile device.  You can quickly order products using our 'Quick Pick' system, or you can customize your orders using our revamped 'Order Online' process. 
    </p>
    <h2>Quick Pick</h2>
    <p>
        Our 'Quick Pick' system is designed to allow you to place your orders for the entire year by selecting the shipments that you would like to receive. We have used our expertise and knowledge to put together the best mixes that your customers will enjoy. You simply choose the quantity required for each of your stores, and their respective ship dates.  
    </p>
    <p>
        You can access 'Quick Pick' by selecting the link on your dashboard, or my clicking on the button in the 'Shop' menu item. 
    </p>
    <p>
        After you have selected the products you wish to purchase, click 'Next' and complete the following details to add the order to your cart:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>'Purchase Order #'
        </li>
        <li>'Order Placed by Name'
        </li>
        <li>'Rack Quantity'
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Once all required fields are entered, click 'Add to Cart' to view a summary of your order.
    </p>
    <p>
        From the Cart Page you will allow you to review your full order. When they are expected to ship, as well as details about your order, here you can see the products ordered, the expected ship date, and the full details of your order.  Should you want to verify the product, click on the 'Draft Order #' and it will provide you with full details of the product. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Should you need to modify your order to remove a product, we have included a delete button for your convenience.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you're satisfied with your order details, click on Submit order. 
    </p>
    <h2>Order Online</h2>
    <p>
        We have also reworked how you can order products from any of our online catalogues. The ‘Shop’ menu allows you to select a catalog to order from, and the available shipping dates are visible right on the menu. 
    </p>
    <p>
        For each item you wish to order, you will be able to see our ‘best mix’ recommended selections. To order the best mix, simply use one of the quick order buttons to quickly select a ship week and place your order. Otherwise, you can customize the rack selections to place an order with the plant material of your choosing.
    </p>
    <p>
        The final step to confirm your order is to enter in an optional 'Purchase Order #', 'Order Placed by Name', and confirm the order quantities.
